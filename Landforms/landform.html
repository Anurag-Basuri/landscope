                <p>The North and Northeastern Mountains consist of the Himalayas and the Northeastern hills. It lies in the north eastern states of the country. Spread over an area of 500000 square kilometer, the Himalayas stretch from the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim to Arunachal Pradesh. The Himalayas are young fold mountains and they are divided into three main ranges that run parallel to each other.The general orientation of these ranges is from northwest to the southeast direction in the northwestern part of India.The approximate length of the Great Himalayan range is 2,500 km from east to west and their width varies between160 to 400 km from north to south. They have snow covered peaks, big and small glaciers and deep gorges and are covered with dense forests.</p>

                <p>Between the Himalayas and the Peninsular Plateau are found the Great Northern Plains that stretch in an east-west direction for about 2,400 km. They lie to the south of the Shivaliks, separated by the Himalayan Frontal Fault (HFF). The southern boundary is a wavy irregular line along the northern edge of Peninsular India. On the eastern side, the plains are bordered by the Purvanchal hills. These plains extend from the state of Haryana, including Delhi, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh, parts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand to West Bengal.The major rivers in the northern plains are Ganga, Yamuna, Chambal, Betwa, Son, Ken, Ghahghra, Gandak, Kosi and Hoogley. The entire northern plains are made of alluvial soil and hence it is agriculturally a very productive part of India. These have been deposited by three important Himalayan river systems– the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. It is drained by many other rivers like Yamuna, Ghaghara, Gandak etc.</p>

            <article class="abtplateau">
                <p>The presence of the plateau adds to the geographical beauty of India. It came into existence with the tectonic shift in Gondwanaland. As a result of this ancient shift, a triangular-shaped plateau was formed and is characterized by curved hills, and channels. The Peninsular plateau is composed of the old crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks. Three different mountain ranges, the Aravallis, the Vidhyas, and the Satpuras, surround the Peninsular Plateau. The plateau which is roughly triangular in shape has it’s base coinciding with the southern edge of the great plain of North India and the apex of the triangular plateau is at Kanyakumari. The Peninsular Plateau covers the eight states namely Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujrat, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Odisha. It covers a total area of about 16 lakh sq km.The height of the plateau varies from region to region and the average height of the plateau is 600 to 900 m above sea level.This plateau consists of two broad divisions, namely, the Central Highlands and the Deccan Plateau.</p>

                <p>The Great Indian Desert is also known as the Thar Desert. It is a sandy plain which lies towards the western margins of the Aravalli Hills. The Indian Desert is an undulating sandy plain covered with sand dunes. This region receives very low rainfall ranging from about 4 inches or less in the west to about 20 inches in the east and has arid climate with low vegetation cover. More than 60% of the desert lies in the Indian state of Rajasthan and a certain portion extends into Gujarat, Punjab, and Haryana.It covers around 200,000 square km of territory.It is bordered by the Indus River plain to the west, the Punjab Plain to the north and northeast, the Aravalli Range to the southeast, and the Rann of Kachchh to the south. The desert has high and low sand dunes separated by sandy plains and low barren hills known as bhakars.</p>

            <article class="abtcostal">
                <p>The Coastal Plains of India lie on either side of the Deccan Plateau, along the western and eastern coasts of India. They extend for about 6,150 km from the Rann of Kutch in the west to West Bengal in the east. The Peninsular plateau is flanked by stretch of narrow coastal strips, running along the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on the east. The western coast, sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, is a narrow plain.It consists of three sections – The northern part of the coast is called the Konkan (Mumbai – Goa), the central stretch is called the Kannad Plain, while the southern stretch is referred to as the Malabar coast. The plains along the Bay of Bengal are wide and level. In the northern part, it is referred to as the Northern Circar, while in the southern part is known as the Coromandel Coast. Large rivers, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri have formed extensive delta on this coast. Lake Chilika is an important feature along the eastern coast.</p>

India has two groups of islands – Lakshadweep Islands group lying close to the Malabar coast of Kerala and Andaman and Nicobar islands located in the Bay of Bengal extending from north to south. Andaman and Nicobar islands are bigger in size and are more numerous and scattered. Other than these two groups there are islands in Indo-Gangetic Delta and between India and Sri Lanka.</p>

            <p>Andaman and Nicobar Islands were formed due to collision between Indian Plate and Burma Minor Plate.
