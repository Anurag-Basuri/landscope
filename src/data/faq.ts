  {
    question: "What makes the Himalayas important for India's climate?",
    answer:
      "The Himalayas act as a natural barrier, blocking cold Central Asian winds from reaching India and trapping monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean, causing heavy rainfall across the subcontinent. They are also the source of major rivers like the Ganga, Yamuna, and Brahmaputra.",
    category: "Geography",
  },
  {
    question: "Why are the Northern Plains so fertile?",
    answer:
      "The Indo-Gangetic Plain is formed by alluvial deposits from the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra river systems over millions of years. The fine silt (Khadar) deposited during annual floods renews the soil's fertility, making it ideal for agriculture — wheat, rice, and sugarcane.",

  },
  {
    question: "What is the Deccan Plateau known for?",
    answer:
      "The Peninsular Plateau (Deccan Plateau) is one of the oldest landmasses on Earth, rich in mineral deposits like iron ore, coal, manganese, and bauxite. It is flanked by the Western Ghats — a UNESCO biodiversity hotspot — and the Eastern Ghats.",
    category: "Geography",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the Thar Desert lifeless?",
    answer:
      "Not at all! The Thar is the world's most densely populated desert and home to remarkable biodiversity. It supports species like the Great Indian Bustard, Indian Wild Ass, and Chinkara. The Khejri tree is so revered that the Bishnoi community sacrificed their lives to protect it in 1730.",

    question: "What is a biodiversity hotspot?",
    answer:
      "A biodiversity hotspot is a region with exceptionally high species diversity that is under severe threat. India has four biodiversity hotspots: the Himalayas, the Western Ghats, the Indo-Burma region, and Sundaland (including the Nicobar Islands). These areas contain a large number of endemic species found nowhere else on Earth.",
